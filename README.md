# Backstage Actions

This repository contains GitHub actions related to Backstage. The goal of the
current actions are to help manage the maintenance of the main Backstage
repository.


## TODO

- [x] Get this repo set up with two initial actions, one for PR sync, and one
      for cron polling.
- [ ] Migrate all existing custom workflow scripts from backstage/backstage into
      these new actions.

  - [x] Migrate `.github/workflows/automate_merge_renovate_prs.yaml`
  - [ ] Migrate `.github/workflows/automate_review-labels-scheduled.yaml`
  - [x] Migrate `.github/workflows/automate_review-labels.yaml`
  - [x] Migrate `.github/workflows/sync_approve_renovate_pr.yaml`
  - [x] Migrate `.github/workflows/sync_issue-labels.yml`
  - [x] Migrate `.github/workflows/verify_dco.yaml`
  - [ ] Maybe migrate `.github/workflows/sync_dependabot-changesets.yml`?
  - [ ] Maybe migrate `.github/workflows/sync_renovate-changesets.yml`?

- New features targeting the maintenance project board:
  - [ ] Remove items from the board instead of setting the status to "Done".
  - [ ] Automate the move to the "Changes Requested" column.
  - [ ] Custom logic for adding PRs to the board, skip PRs that do not have DCO,
        but add them once they do.
